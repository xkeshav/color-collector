# css color collector

A vs code extension that works with css file, collect all color values from a css file and replace with a meaningful variable name and put all these color variables in a new :root pseudo selector

## Description

In an open CSS file, on execution of `collect colors` command, this extension parse the open file and read all color written in the file and and assign every color value to a meaningful variable name and replace the color value with variable and these color variables collected under a `:root` pseudo selector.

## Use Case

This approach has a few benefits.  

First, it can help make your code more readable by giving names to colors that might otherwise be difficult to remember.  

Second, it can help you avoid duplicating colors throughout your code.  

And third, if you ever need to change a color value, you can do so in one place and have the change propagate throughout your entire stylesheet.

## Install

- in VSCode, Open extension panel from activity bar and choose the menu options for _View â†’ Extensions_ or use <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd>
- Search for `css color collector`
- Click _Install_

## Settings and Configuration

Open Settings using <kbd>Cmd + , </kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl + ,</kbd> and search **color collector** 

![cs code settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xkeshav/color-collector/main/images/vscode-settings-for-color-collector.png))

1. if you need to run this extension for .scss file ( which is experimental though) then add following setting

```json
"cssColorCollector.lookupFiles": [
      "**/*.css",
      "**/*.scss",
      "**/*.less"
]
```

1.  To create a separate file for collected color then open your _Workspace_ ( if no workspace then in _User_ ) Settings and 
   search for _css.color.collector_ and check the tick box for _Color In Separate File_ option or write below key in the setting file

```json
"cssColorCollector.colorInSeparateFile": true
```

then a new file will be created same as to the open file location, and new file name in below format

**color-collector--[open file name].css**

and new file will be open after conversion done successfully.

## Features

- Collect all supported color format such as `hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`, `hwb`, `lab()`, `oklab()`, `lch`, `oklch()`, `color()` and 148 named color.
- Prevent duplicate hex color with variation and assign it into same variable name based on which comes first in the file.
  for eg. `#fff` and `#ffffff` and `#ffffffff` are same color.
- color variable name are intuitive, included property and selector name as prefix. for eg.

```css
body {
  background-color: whitesmoke;
}
```

will be converted into

```css
:root {
  --body-bg-1: whitesmoke;
}

body {
  background-color: --body-bg-1;
}
```

- Each variable suffixed with `-<number>` to keep track how many colors are collected.

- After successfully execution of the command, the css file will be updated in 2 ways

- color value will be replaced by these new css variable in the file on the same place/

- if `colorInSeparateFile` is enabled then an import statement will be added on the top of file and new file will be generated where all collected color will be written. with comment of respective file name and date of conversion.
  
- if `colorInSeparateFile` is not enabled then a new `:root` pseudo selector will be added on the top of the file with all collected variable in it's declaration block (after all `import` statements as per css specification )

- After successful execution of command , vs code will display notification.

## How to Use

- Open a css file ( or sass file )
- Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to open the command palette
- Type `ccc` and select _collect colors_ command OR use keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl + F7</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd + F7</kbd>
- if there are any error while running the command then notification message will appears
- After completion of command, you will see notification message of successful conversion.

- [ ] To revert back the changes in file, user need to do undo 2 times just after conversion.
- [ ] scss file support, which works partially. need to check for less file also
- [ ] support for new color format `color-mix()` and `color-contrast()` [reference](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/11/guide-modern-css-colors/)
- [ ] if there are style declaration above :root {} then this extension will not parse those lines
- [ ] create web extension for the same, currently it is for desktop

### Known issues

- _"invalid flag 'dgim'"_
  if you run the command and get above error then check whether you have [todo-tree extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) enabled in vs code then please disable that extension to make this extension work properly. [issue raised on the same](https://github.com/Gruntfuggly/todo-tree/issues/732) and checking for solution
