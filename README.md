# css color collector

A simple vs code extension that works with _.css_ files and assigns all colors into the css variables.

## Description

In an open CSS file, this extension parse file for all color values and collect the color value and assign into an descriptive variable for every different color and include all these variables in a `:root` pseudo-class at the very top, also replace the color values in file with these new variable name.

## Use Case

This approach has a few benefits. First, it can help make your code more readable by giving names to colors that might otherwise be difficult to remember. Second, it can help you avoid duplicating colors throughout your code. And third, if you ever need to change a color value, you can do so in one place and have the change propagate throughout your entire stylesheet.

## Install

- Open Extensions sideBar panel in VS Code and choose the menu options for _View â†’ Extensions_ or use `Ctrl + Shift + X` or `Cmd + Shift + X`
- Search for `css color collector` ,
- Click _Install_

## Settings and Configuration

open vs code settings ( <kbd>Cmd + , </kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl + ,</kbd>) and search __css color collector__

you will see 3 settings and all are optional

![extension settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xkeshav/color-collector/main/images/settings.png)

1. if you need to run this extension for .scss/ .less also then add below setting as following
  
```json
"cssColorCollector.lookupFiles": [
      "**/*.css",
      "**/*.scss",
      "**/*.less"
]
```

1.  if you want to create a separate file for collected color variable write below settings 

```json
"cssColorCollector.colorInSeparateFile": true
```
if it is true then a new file name will be created on same file location where current open css file is, and the new file name will be in **root-[open file name first word]-collector.css** format 

## Features

- Collect all supported color format such as `hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`, `hwb`, `lab()`, `oklab()`, `lch`, `oklch()`, `color()` and 148 named color.
- Prevent duplicate hex color with variation and assign it into same variable name based on which comes first in the file.
for eg. `#fff` and `#ffffff` and `#ffffffff` are same color.
- color variable name are intuitive, included property and selector name as prefix. for eg.

```css
body {
  background-color: whitesmoke;
}
```

will be converted into

```css
:root {
  --body-bg-1: whitesmoke;
}

body {
  background-color: --body-bg-1;
}
```

- each variable name ends with `-<num>` to keep track how many colors are collected and used, further you can rename the variable using `Rename Symbol(F2)` action in vs code.

- After successfully execution of the command, the css file will be updated in 2 ways
  
    - color value will be replaced by css variables and 
    - if `colorInSeparateFile` option enabled then an import statement will be added on the top of file and new file will be generated where all collected color will be written.
    - otherwise a`:root` block will be added on the top of the file (after all `import` statements as per css specification )

- After successful execution of command , vs code will display notification.

## Release Notes

- This is my first extension so if you find it useful then please support it by installing and giving constructive feedback.

### Known issues

- error _"invalid flag 'dgim'"_
  if you run the command or press `Ctrl + F7` and get above error then check whether you have [todo-tree extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) enabled in your vs code then please disable this extension, the reason is unknown so far, [issue raised for the same](https://github.com/Gruntfuggly/todo-tree/issues/732)

- if you found any issue, kindly raise [here](https://github.com/xkeshav/color-collector/issues/)

## TODO

- [] add feature to change variable naming for property , currently its hard coded like if property is `background-color` then its variable name would be `bg`
- [] To revert back the changes in file, user need to do undo 2 times just after conversion, that need to handle
- [] scss file support, which works partially
- [] support for new color format `color-mix()` and `color-contrast()` [reference](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/11/guide-modern-css-colors/)
- value currentColor, transparent, system-color are not being checked
