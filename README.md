# css color collector

A vs code extension which works with css file, collect every color from the file and replace it with a meaningful css variable and place these variables under a new `:root` pseudo selector block

## Description

In an open css file, on execution of `collect colors` command, this extension parse the file and search all color value across all supported color syntax and and assign every color value to a meaningful css variable name and replace the color value with variable and these color variables collected under a `:root` pseudo selector.

## Use Case

This approach has a few benefits.

First, it can help make your code more readable by giving names to colors that might otherwise be difficult to remember.

Second, it can help you avoid duplicating colors throughout your code.

And third, if you ever need to change a color value, you can do so in one place and have the change propagate throughout your entire stylesheet.

## Install

- open VSCode, and go to extension panel from activity bar or type <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd>
- search for `css color collector`
- Click _Install_
- reload the vscode if it is prompted

## How to Use

- Open a css file ( or sass file )
- Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to open command palette.
- Type `ccc` and select _collect colors_ command or alternatively use keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl + F7</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd + F7</kbd>
- if there are any error in file while running the command then notification message will be displayed.
- After completion of the command, a notification message of successful conversion will be displayed.

## Configuration Option

To create a separate file for `:root` block then open your _Workspace_ ( if no workspace then in _User_ ) settings, using <kbd>Cmd + , </kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl + ,</kbd> and
search **css color collector** and check the tick box for against _Color In Separate File_ option

![vs code settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xkeshav/color-collector/main/images/vscode-settings-for-color-collector.png))

```json
"cssColorCollector.colorInSeparateFile": true
```

## Features

- Collect all supported color format such as `hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`, `hwb`, `lab()`, `oklab()`, `lch`, `oklch()`, `color()` and 148 named color.
- Prevent duplicate hex color with variation and assign it into same variable name based on which comes first in the file.
  for eg. `#fff` and `#ffffff` and `#ffffffff` are same color.
- color variable name are intuitive, included property and selector name as prefix. for eg.

```css
body {
  background-color: whitesmoke;
}
```

will be converted into

```css
:root {
  --body-bg-1: whitesmoke;
}

body {
  background-color: --body-bg-1;
}
```

_Note:_ if extension unable to parse property and selector of a color then variable name would be `--defaultSelector__defaultElement--<number>`

- Each variable name suffixed with `-<number>` to keep track how many colors are collected.

- variable name value will be stored in lowercase only, so `Black`or `BlaCK` will be stored under same variable name and value will be `black`

- After successfully execution of the command, the css file will be updated in 2 ways

  1. color value will be replaced with css variable names in the file.
  2. all css variables will be collected and placed under a `:root` pseudo selector and the placement of `:root` block depends on the configuration as follow

    - if `cssColorCollector.colorInSeparateFile` is not set or `false` then a new `:root` pseudo selector will be added on the top of the, after all `import` statements as per css specification )  
    - if `cssColorCollector.colorInSeparateFile` is enabled ( i.e. `true` ) then `:root` will be placed in new file and an import statement will be added on the top of the open file.
    
 _Note:_ New file will be created in the same directory where the css file is opened and naming convention of file would be _color-collector--[open-file-name].css_ and multi line comment will be added on top of `:root` which mention the source file and date of conversion.
   
- After successful execution of command, extension will display notification message.


- comment will be added over the `:root` block or `@import` statement to identify the changes.

- A notification message will be displayed after successful execution of the _collect colors_ command.

moreover, if you want to contribute, please feel free to raise the [PR](https://github.com/xkeshav/color-collector/pulls)

## Future Work

- [ ] add feature to change variable naming for property , currently its hard coded like if property is `background-color` then its variable name would be `bg`
- [ ] currently, to revert back the changes made by extension, user need to do undo 2 times just after the conversion.
- [ ] check for scss file support, which works partially. need to check for less file also
- [ ] add support for new color format `color-mix()` and `color-contrast()` [reference](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/11/guide-modern-css-colors/)
- [ ] if there are style declaration above :root {} then this extension will not parse those lines, which need to handle.
- [ ] develop web extension for the same, currently it is for desktop

## Known issues

- _"invalid flag 'dgim'"_
  if you run the command and get above error then check whether you have [todo-tree extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) enabled in vs code then please disable that extension to make this extension work properly. [issue raised on the same](https://github.com/Gruntfuggly/todo-tree/issues/732) and checking for solution
