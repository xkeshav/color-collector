# css-color-collector

A simple vs code extension that works with _.css_ files and assigns all colors into the css variables.

## Description

In an open CSS file, this extension parse file for all color values and collect the color value and assign into an descriptive variable for every different color and include all these variables in a `:root` pseudo-class at the very top, also replace the color values in file with these new variable name.

## Use Case

This approach has a few benefits. First, it can help make your code more readable by giving names to colors that might otherwise be difficult to remember. Second, it can help you avoid duplicating colors throughout your code. And third, if you ever need to change a color value, you can do so in one place and have the change propagate throughout your entire stylesheet.

## Install

- Open Extensions sideBar panel in VS Code and choose the menu options for _View â†’ Extensions_ or use `Ctrl + Shift + X` or `Cmd + Shift + X`
- Search for `css color collector` ,
- Click _Install_

## Features

- Collect all supported color format such as `hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`, `hwb` `oklab()`, `lch`, `color()` and 148 named color.
- Prevent duplicate hex color with variation and assign it into same variable name based on which comes first in the file.
for eg. `#fff` and `#ffffff` and `#ffffffff` are same color.
- Names of variables are intuitive and include property and selector name as prefixes. for eg.

below css file

```css
body {
  background-color: whitesmoke;
}
```

will be converted into

```css
:root {
  --body-bg-1: whitesmoke;
}

body {
  background-color: --body-bg-1;
}
```

- each variable name ends with `-<num>` to keep track how many colors are collected and used, further you can rename the variable using `Rename Symbol(F2)` action in vs code.

- After successfully execution of the command, the css file will be changed where color value will be replaced by css variables and a `:root` selector will be placed on the top of the file,after all `import` statements and also display notification of successful conversion.

## Extension Usage

- Open a css file
- Press <kbd>F1</kbd> to open the command palette
- Type `ccc` and select `collect colors` command or type <kbd>Ctrl + F7</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd + F7</kbd>
- After conversion done, you will see notification on bottom with message _variable conversion done successfully!_
- To revert back the changes in file, user need to do undo 2 times just after conversion.
