# color-collector

A simple vs code extension that works with _.css_ files and assigns all colors into the css variables.

## Description

In an open CSS file, this extension scans for all color values.
and collect the color value and assign into an individual variable for every different color and include all these variables in a `:root` selector at the top of document.
and replace the color values with the new variable name in the same CSS file,

## Install

- Open Extensions sideBar panel in Visual Studio Code and choose the menu options for _View â†’ Extensions_ or use `Ctrl + Shift + X` or `Cmd + Shift + X`
- Search for `css color collector`
- Click _Install_

## Features

- Collect all color format, including `hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`, `hwb` and 148 named color.
- Names of variables are intuitive and include property and selector as prefixes
- Prevent duplicate color and assign it into same variable name ( which comes first in file)
- a different hex format of color also counted as duplicate color and handled properly. for eg. `#fff` and `#ffffff` and `#fffffff` are same color

```css
body {
  background-color: whitesmoke;
}
```

converted into

```css
:root {
  --body-bg-1: whitesmoke;
}

body {
  background-color: --body-bg-1;
}
```

note: variable ends with `-<num>` to keep track how many colors are collected and used, further you can rename the variable using `Rename Symbol(F2)` action in vs code.

- After successfully execution of the command, the css file will be changed where color value will be replaced by css variables and a `:root` selector will be placed on the top of the file,after all `import` statements and also display notification of successful conversion.
