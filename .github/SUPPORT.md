## Asking quality questions

Questions can go to [GitHub discussions][discussion].

Help us help you!

Spend time framing questions and add links and resources.  
Spending the extra time up front can help save everyone time in the long run.

> [!Tip]
> Here are some tips

- [Talk to us][chat]!
- Don’t fall for the [XY problem][xy]
- Search to find out if a similar question has been asked
- Try to define what you need help with:
  - Is there something in particular you want to do?
  - What problem are you encountering and what steps have you taken to try and fix it?
  - Is there a concept you don’t understand?
- Provide sample code, such as a [CodeSandbox][cs] or [StackBlitz][sb] or a small video, if possible
- Screenshots can help, but if there’s important text such as code or error messages in them, please also provide those as text
- The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you
